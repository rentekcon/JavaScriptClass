   <li> One interesting thing you can do in the Phoenix area is indoor sky-diving
		It is located in Scottsdale off the 101. <a href="https://www.indoorskydivingsource.com/tunnels/ifly-phoenix/"> iFLY Phoenix</a></li>
	<li> One I especially enjoyed is the hot air ballooning with the dinner included
		take a jacket though it gets cool at night and up in the balloon. 
		Also, duck down in the basket because one person in our group had her hat torn off and 
		her coat torn. She could have had her hair and more torn off but she got lucky. <a href="floatballoontours.com">Hot Air Ballooning</a></li>
